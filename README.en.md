# OW Anti-kun (OW Counter Picker)

"I want to run Reaper into Winston, but they have Pharah... I'm not sure what to play!"
This tool is for Overwatch players who feel that way: just input the enemy comp and it shows recommended heroes.

If you want to add counter data or report bugs, please DM Bobayashi: https://x.com/boba_yashi

## Features

* **Real-time ranking**: Each time you select a hero, recommended counter picks update immediately. You can check counters starting from a single hero.
* **Role queue (5v5) support**: The standard role limits (Tank 1 / Damage 2 / Support 2) are the default, and you can also remove role restrictions.
* **Detailed database**: See each hero's counter picks and which comp types (Dive / Rush / Poke) they are strong against. There is still lots to improve, and it might become editable.

## How to Use

1. **Select the enemy team**: Click up to 5 enemy heroes from the center grid.
2. **Check recommended counters**: The "Recommended Counter Picks" area on the right (or below on mobile) shows heroes by role, sorted by score. Use the down arrow to view all heroes.
3. **See the reasons**: Each card shows reasons like "strong vs Zarya" or "weak vs poke" to help with decision-making.
